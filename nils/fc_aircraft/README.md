My intention here was to create a FC aircraft model based off example_cryo.jl, but then I emailed Prashanth on 20.08.2025 to ask if they had created such an example case already.
He replied on 25.08.2025 saying they had not but might later, so I decided to abandon this for now and focus on adding a point loads to wing and fuselage that are propulsion-agnostic.
